With this extension you are able to directly search data items from
[Wikidata] (http://www.wikidata.org).

* Enable the extension in ```gnome-tweak-tool```

Use
====
* To search for "GNOME" open the overview and type ```wd GNOME```
(You need to prefix all of your search with ```wd```.)
* To search for "kitob" in Uzbek type ```wd-uz kitob```
(```uz``` is the language code for Uzbek. You can use any other code such as
 ```ru```, ```ko```, etc. If you omit the language code, the default language
 of English will be used.)

* To search for the translation of "book" in Uzbek open the overview and
type ```wd-en-uz book``` (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
